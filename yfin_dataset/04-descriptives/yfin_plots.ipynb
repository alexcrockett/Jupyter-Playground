Histograms and frequency plots in general will help us see how the data is shaped. We saw that there is a high range for scores. We have not yet explored kurtosis. We should first look at how means and other scores are distributed. We should also produce boxplots to visually verify using 'set_2' over 'set_1'. It will also be interesting to compare different groups as well as see what various plots exploring associations look like.\n",
